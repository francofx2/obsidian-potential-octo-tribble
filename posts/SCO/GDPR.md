### How to implement GDPR compliant forms in SCO?

#### Mailchimp
https://mailchimp.com/gdpr/
>When relying on consent as your legal basis for processing, the GDPR says the consent you obtain must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. You also must clearly explain how you plan to use your contacts’ personal data. We’ve updated Mailchimp signup forms to help you stay compliant with this law. Our optional, GDPR-friendly forms include checkboxes for opt-in consent, and editable sections that explain how and why you’re using data.

#### Access GDPR Options in "Audiences"
